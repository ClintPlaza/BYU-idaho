            <p> The activities will help you feel the excitement with your family. These kinds of events are reliable for all people. 
                We have morning and night activities. 
            </p>
            <h2> Morning Activities </h2>
            <p> In the morning activities, we will shuttle you to Hells Canyon Dam for the start of your multi-day river excursion. 
                For people choosing to join us for 3 days, trips will end 32 miles downriver at Pittsburg Landing. On 3-day trips, the shuttle fee is not included in your trip cost and we will help arrange for your vehicle to be shuttled to Pittsburg Landing or arrange a "jetpack" for your group to be jet boated back to Hells Canyon Dam. 
                For those opting for a longer float, we will end almost 79 miles downriver at Heller Bar. From the takeout location, you will be shuttled back to your vehicle at the Minam Store or you can pay an additional fee to have your vehicle shuttled to the takeout. 
            </p>
             <h2> Evening Activities </h2>
            <p> You might be wondering, though, what can we do as a family when it gets dark? Well, we’re here to tell you, that the fun doesn’t have to stop when the sun goes down. Here is our activity for night. Sit around campfire -A staple for a lot of camping trips is to sit around the campfire. Play games around the fire. If you have a little too much energy left to sit around the fire, you can play super easy games that don’t require a lot of set up like charades, truth or dare, two truths and a lie, and who am I? StarGaze If the fire is dying out and you’re lucky enough to be far enough away from the city lights, take some time to lean back and stare at the never-ending stars.
