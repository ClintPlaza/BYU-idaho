            <p> “When safety is first, you last.” Safety is our number one priority. We provided an equipment for our loving costumer and we make sure that
                they are safe and protected. We have a life vest and helmet for rivers. We are prepared the first aid kit. Make sure to keep an eye on the weather forecast before your trip. As we all know, weather can change within the hour, which means it’s essential to pack for inclement weather such as rain, snow, and high heat and humidity.
